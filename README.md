# Westward C++

A Oregon Trail clone that written in C++.

## About the project

This project was created to help me (pylua) learn to code in C++. So far, I have primarily programmed in higher-level languages, mainly C#, Python, Lua, and Web3 (HTML, JavaScript, CSS). My lack of experience with lower-level programming languages has made some coding problems more challenging for me to solve, so I wanted to learn C++. This project is the result of my first attempt at C++ programming. Below you can find information about this project like libraries, machine, tools, and compilers I used to make it.

## Information

> Libraries

`NCurses` - Used for display

`Boost` - Used for managing and reading files for saving data

`SFML` - Used for audio management

> Creation

`Machine` - Thinkpad Yoga X1 Gen 5

`OS` - Arch Linux

`Linux Compiler` - GCC/G++

`Windows Compiler` - MinGW-GCC

> Tools Used:

`VSCode` - Editor

`CMake` - Buildfile Generator

## Builds

> Pre-builts

Builds will not be available for some time as the game is at the time of writing barely even planned out. When the game is closer to being done, nightly builds will become available for windows and linux under Actions/Latest/Artifacts. When the game is ready for releases, you can find that under Releases/Latest.
